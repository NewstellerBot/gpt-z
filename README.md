# GPT-z 

What would happen if we trained a transformer model on something generated purely by generation z? Generative pretrained transformers are usually trained on huge corpuses of data to give them enough data and context to generate plausible text, but here we take a different approach and train it on pure non-sesne: college students group chat.

# Introduction

The world was taken by storm by generative models: ChatGPT, Llama, Mistral, Claude, Grok, and I could spend the next two weeks enumerating other models... But all of these seem to have a common denominator‚Äîthe underlying transformer model. In this round, I wanted to take a stab at generating text! Since the previous dataset wasn't that big, I decided to move on to a much bigger one: M25 group chat.

# Data

Let's take a look at the gathered data.

## Size


```python
import math

with open("input.txt", 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()

orders = math.log10(len(data))
```

Drum rolls please!


```python
round(orders, 2)
```




    6.91



We have slightly less than $10^7$ tokens in the gathered data, which will hopefully be enough to train an interesting model without overfitting it too much.

## Quality Control üßë‚Äçüç≥

Okay, we have a lot of example, but let's see how good the data actually is!


```python
import numpy as np

block_size = 50
n_examples = 5
idx = np.random.randint(0, len(data), (n_examples,))

for ix in idx:
    print(data[ix:ix+block_size])
```

Emojis, abbreviations, random characters at times‚Äîlooks about right! This is probably not the best data to create a foundational model (who has compute for that anyways, ehh...), but it will be fun for a toy model.

# Converting to Python readable format

This step is quite simple since the data is collected in a single text file. We can just follow the steps above to read it from a file to a big big string.

# Pre-processing

## Cleaning up

Since this is a generative model that I will work on, I do not want to clean the data to keep all the quirkiness of a Minerva group chat. Therefore, the data will be used "as is."

## Encoding

### Motivation

Models usually work with numeric data rather than strings or characters. For this assignment, I wish to utilize the transformer architecture, which works with discrete tokens. Those tokens can be created in multiple different ways, such as word-level encoding (each word is a token), byte-pair encoding (widely used in the industry), or character-level (encoding), which is arguably the simplest one, and for that reason will be in this work.

### How it works?

The idea is quite simple‚Äîwe treat each character as a "token." To do that, we find all possible characters‚Äîthe vocabulary list‚Äîin the dataset and assign a unique value to each. Then, the strings are passed through that encoding, which becomes a big list of numbers instead of chars.


```python
vocab = sorted(list(set(data)))
ch2ix = {ch:ix for ix, ch in enumerate(vocab)}
ix2ch = {ix:ch for ix, ch in enumerate(vocab)}

encode = lambda s: [ch2ix[ch] for ch in s]
decode = lambda t: ''.join([ix2ch[ix] for ix in t])
```


```python
encoded_data = encode(data)
encoded_data[:10]
```




    [78, 80, 84, 85, 1, 80, 71, 1, 85, 73]



As we can see, the data is now a list of numbers! We should also make sure the decoding works.


```python
example = "some super long string with different characters!#$!@@!$#"

assert decode(encode(example)) == example
assert decode(encode('')) == ''
assert decode(encode(data[10_000:])) == data[10_000:]
```

It looks like it works!

# Task

## Description

The task is quite simple‚Äîgenerate text that looks like a text from the m25 group chat.

The task conceptually is trivial (I think), but the "how" is the hard part :), which we will dive into very soon.

## Train-test split

Since the dataset is quite big, and we want to use many examples for training (it is a generative model, after all), we will use 90% for training and 10% for validation. The model will be tested by generating new text and seeing how well it did (hopefully, we will be able to see some actual words...).

# Model

![Model](model.png)

## Motivation

Creating a generative model for text can be as hard and as simple as we make it. For example, a bi-gram model is a simple look-up table that predicts the probability of the next token given the previous token. We can improve on this model by using the n-gram model, which uses n-1 previous tokens to predict the next one. However, we can also go as far as implementing something like a state space model with HiPPOs, which uses a combination of signal processing, a clever way of encoding past information in latent space, and hardware optimizations, but we won't get into that yet...

For this assignment, I wanted to implement something effective yet relatively simple, so the choices were some kind of RNN (vanilla, LSTM, or GRU), convolutional model, such as wave net, or transformers. I went with the latter as I wanted to dig deeper into that architecture for a while; however, the others will be used for comparison.

## How does the transformer work?

### Embedding

Before processing the tokens, we want to give them semantical meaning. The transformer does that by embedding layers. It takes the list of tokens, which in our case are integers, as input and uses a look-up table to give `d' dimensional vectors back. It works a bit like an autoencoder because it can reduce the dimensionality of data (instead of having a list of one-hot encoded vectors for each example of vocabulary size, we reduce the dimension to the desired dimensions).

### Positional Encoding

As transformers are not recurrent models, there is no notion of time in the input, so we need to add it. We do that by creating a time vector. This is simply a vector from 0 to the length of input tokens. For example, if there are 3 tokens in the input, the time vector would be `[0, 1, 2]`. Then, those vectors are embedded in `d` dimensional space (similar to the tokens; note, however, that it's a map from a number of tokens to `d` dimensions rather than from vocabulary size to `d`). Lastly, they are added to the embedded tokens to give them a sense of time. 

Important note: both embedding tables are learned parameters in the model.

### Attention!

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q \, K^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) \, V
$$

More precisely, scaled dot-product attention‚Äîthe heart of the model. The idea behind it is so that the tokens can "communicate" with each other, which happens through calculating the compatibility score between the tokens.

![attention.png](attention.png)

At first, we use 3 different linear projections to create 3 vectors: key, query, and value that will represent "what I have," "what I am looking for," and the latent space of the token. The first two are used to calculate the weights, which we use for a weighted average of values vector (the softmax function is applied to normalize values to sum to 1). To illustrate what I mean by all this, I've trained a very small model with one attention block and visualized the weights before multiplied with $V$, i.e., $\text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q \, K^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)$.

The corpus it was trained on was

```python
data = 'hello this is some simple dataset for a super small transformer'
```

**Untrained Model**

![untrained_attn.png](untrained_attn.png)

**Trained Model**

![trained_attn.png](trained_attn.png)

Note that the model has a decoder-only architecture in this example, and thus, the attention is causal (the model cannot see into the future, which is signified by the black pixels in the upper right part of the image).

As shown above, before the model was trained, the attention was distributed roughly equally amongst all the tokens. After training, however, the attention is more focused. When it sees a novel after another vowel (i.e., "o" after "e"), it focuses its attention on the previous vowel. Or, when it sees two consonants in a row, it focuses on the previous consonants to predict the next token. Neat!

![multihead.png](multihead.png)

Authors mentioned that they found that creating $n$ $\frac{d}{n}$ dimensional heads was beneficial to the model's performance as it allowed for the tokens to be attended from different learned linear projections at different positions.

$$
\text{MultiHeadAttention}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V))
$$
 
In code, all this is implemented using the same matrix multiplications for faster computation.

### MLP

After all the attention magic is done, we also apply a simple linear layer, followed by a non-linearity, which essentially is a multi-layer perceptron with a single hidden layer (in my implementation, it specifically has a size of 4 times the embedding dimensionality).

### GeLU vs ReLU

For the activation function, you might notice that I used GeLU instead of the more popular ReLU or Tanh. ReLU is usually preferred as Tanh struggles with the vanishing gradients problem (the gradient vanishing to exist after a couple of layers). This happens because the derivative of tanh is $1 - \text{tanh}^2(x)$, which has a range between 0 and 1, and more importantly, it has a narrow range, where its value is not close to 0 as shown on the plot below.

![tanh](tanh.png)

ReLU function is a step in the right direction as its range allows neurons to express more extreme opinions than in tanh because its inverse domain is from 0 to $\infty$; however, now a new problem arises. ReLU is not differentiable at 0 (not a huge problem; just assume the value of derivative 0 or 1). However, through research, people found that a smoother, non-monotonic activation function is better as it allows for capturing more complex relationships in data; thus, GeLU was born.

GeLU uses a cdf of a normal distribution to create a similar shape to ReLU while maintaining the differentiability and non-monotonic properties, resulting in improved performance.

![relu vs gelu](relu_vs_gelu.png)

### Layer Norm

Layer normalization stems from batch normalization. Batch normalization was first introduced by Ioffe & Szegedy (2015) to alleviate the problem of already mentioned exploding/vanishing gradients. The idea behind this was quite simple: calculate the mean and variance across the batch dimension. Then, the output that is scaled by a factor $\gamma$ and $\beta$ (both of which are learned parameters) is added to restore the representative power to the model.

$$
\hat{x}^{(k)} = \frac{x^{(k)} - \text{E}[x^{(k)}]}{\sqrt{\text{Var}[x^{(k)}]}}
$$

$$
y^{(k)} = \gamma^{(k)} \hat{x}^{(k)} + \beta^{(k)}
$$

where $x^{(k)}$ is a mini-batch sampled from the dataset, $\text{E}$ is the expected value, and $\text{Var}$ is the variance.

Introducing the batch normalization has been shown to improve the network's performance.

Layer normalization works exactly the same, but instead of normalizing on the batch dimension, it normalizes along the features. It seems that Layer Normalization is better suited for NLP as the size of the sequence can often differ, which requires different statistics for different time steps, according to Be et al. (2016).

### Residual Connection

![residual](residual.png)

Residual connection is the idea of adding an identity of the input to the output of the layer. The intuition behind it is that optimizing to find a value to fix the error (residual) is easier than fitting the bare unreferenced value (He et al., 2016). This idea is quite simple, yet improves learning; thus, it has been widely adopted.


### Dropout

![dropout](dropout.png)

Introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014), it is a method to prevent network overrelying on some neurons. Dropout deletes certain neurons with a probability $p$ at training, as shown on the right side of the image above. At inference, all neurons are utilized; however, the weights are scaled by the factor of $p$; for example, weights for $i$ th layer would be $W_i p$.

## Optimization

### RMSProp

Now that we have figured out how the transformer works let's dig deeper into optimizing its parameters. In the code, I used an optimizer called "AdamW." It builds up on a popular optimizer, Adam, which itself is a combination of RMSProp (an idea popularized by Geoffrey Hinton) and momentum. The prior technique scales the learning rate by a factor of squared gradients apart from the previous step. Mathematically, 

$$
\nabla f(\theta_{t-1}) = g_t
$$

where $f$ is the function, we optimize for (loss function), $\theta$ are the network's parameters, and $t$ is the time step.

$$
v_t = \beta_1 \cdot v_{t - 1} + (1 - \beta_1) \cdot g_t^2
$$

where $g_t^2$ is the gradient vector piece-wise multiplied with itself, $\beta$ is a decay factor, which is a hyperparameter, and $v_0 = 0$.

$$
\alpha_t = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{v_t} + \epsilon}
$$

where $\alpha$ is the base learning rate (a hyperparameter), $\alpha_t$ is the learning rate at time-step $t$, and $\epsilon$ is a small number to prevent division by zero.

While no formal paper introduces this method, the intuition behind it is quite simple. We want to "dampen" the learning rate when the gradients grow. On the other hand, when we are in the flat regions of the gradient, we want to increase the optimizer's learning rate (step size). This happens because we divide the learning rate by a factor of $v_t$, directly and linearly related to the gradient. Note that $v_t$ is a vector, so each parameter's learning rate is adapted.

### Momentum

Momentum is a technique that prevents the model from getting stuck in local minima. The idea is to keep track of previous gradients and decay them over time. Mathematically,

$$
m_t = m_{t-1} \cdot \beta_2 + g_t \cdot (1 - \beta_2)
$$

where $m_t$ is the momentum term for time step $t$, and $\beta_2$ is a hyperparameter. Then, $m_t$ is used to adjust the learning rate:

$$
\alpha_t = \alpha \cdot m_t
$$

### Adam

Putting it together, we get Adam, a combination of RMSProp and Momentum. Then, the learning rate is determined as follows

$$
\alpha_t = \frac{\alpha \cdot m_t}{{\sqrt{v_t} + \epsilon}}
$$

In the code implementation, we also divide the $v_t$ and $m_t$ by $1 - \beta_1^t$ and $1 - \beta_2^t$, respectively, to reduce the bias.

### AdamW

AdamW is, as the name might suggest, Adam with decoupled Weight decay, which acts as a type of normalization. As mentioned in Loshchilov & Hutter (2019), simple L2 or L1 norm is less effective in the case of Adam because the gradient is scaled anyway due to the RMSProp term. Mathematically, those norms would be expressed in the $g_t$ term.

$$
g_t = \nabla f(\theta_{t-1}) + \lambda \theta_{t - 1}
$$

Loshchilov & Hutter (2019) suggest that using decoupled weight decay, which is added to the update term at the end, leads to better results.

$$
\alpha_t = \alpha \cdot \left(\frac{m_t}{{\sqrt{v_t} + \epsilon}} + \lambda \theta_{t - 1}\right)
$$

All other steps follow from the original version of Adam. Also note that, in the paper, they also suggest that using a learning rate schedule helps to improve performance, and cosine annealing has proved to be the most successful. We will use that fact when implementing the training loop of the final architecture. Below, I implemented an AdamW from scratch and compared it to the Pytorch on a simple MLP for XOR.

    else:

    return logits, loss

oz = F.sigmoid(MLP(params, torch.tensor([[1, 0]]).float())[0]).round().item()
oo = F.sigmoid(MLP(params, torch.tensor([[1, 1]]).float())[0]).round().item()

assert (zz, zo, oz, oo) == (0., 1., 1., 0.)
```

Looks like this implementation follows the Pytorch's version pretty well :)

Note that this implementation will not be used for the actual model as the Pytorch version has a similar API, yet introduces kernel-level optimizations; thus, it will be used instead.

## Putting it all together

### Forward Pass (step 1)

The first step to optimizing the model is calculating the forward pass. It uses existing weights, which at first are intialized randomly, to calculate the logits for the next token given the history. The model would use the transformer architecture described above.

### Calculate Loss (step 2)

The next step is calculating the loss function, with respect to which the model is optimized. Since this is a classification problem‚Äî"what is the next token in the sequence"‚Äîcross entropy is used.

$$
H\left(P^{*}, P\right) = -\sum_{i=1}^{\text{Vocabulary Size}} P^{*}(w_i) \cdot \log{P(w_i)}
$$

where $P^*$ is the true probability distribution of words, $P$ is predicted distribution (from the model), and $w_i$ is $i$ th word in the vocabulary.

### Backward Pass (step 3)

Lastly, partial derivatives of loss function w.r.t. each parameter of the model is calculated to update the weights as prescribed in the previously described AdamW optimizer. Then, this process is repeated for number of iterations to achieve desired loss level.

The loss has a nice curve; there is not much discrepancy between the validation and train, which is a good sign that model did not overfit.

# Out of Sample Predictions and Performance

To evaluate the model, we will look at the output (is it total gibberish?), and the cross entropy on a sampled part from the dataset (since the whole test set is too big).

## Generation


```python
# Load the state with the lowest validation loss and generate text using it
chkpt = torch.load('transformer.pth', map_location='cpu')
best_model = SimpleLM(config)
best_model.load_state_dict(chkpt['model'])
config['device'] = 'cpu'
print(generate(best_model, '\n', temperature=0.8, max_tokens=1024))
```

Similarily to the transformer architecture, the loss seem to converge quite nicely together, which makes us confident that the model did not overfit.


```python
# LSTMs can have infinite context, so the function was modified 
# to remove the part where we cut the input to context length

# Note: this function could be greatly improved for performance by 
# storing the hidden state from the LSTM layer if one were to deploy
# this model in practice; similarily to what is done with KV cache 
# in transformer-based architectures

def generate_lstm(model, prompt, max_tokens = 256, temperature = 1):
    model.eval()
    X = encode(prompt)
    X = torch.tensor(X).unsqueeze(0).to(config['device'])
    generated = []
    h, c = (None, None)

    for _ in range(max_tokens):
        logits, _ = model(X, hidden=(h, c))
        logits /= temperature

        ch = torch.distributions.Categorical(logits=logits).sample()
        generated.append(ch.item())
        X = torch.cat((X, ch.unsqueeze(0)), dim=1)

    return decode(generated)
```

## Text Generation

### LSTM


```python
# Load the state with the lowest validation loss and generate text using it
chkpt = torch.load('lstm.pth', map_location='cpu')
best_model = LSTMLM(config)
best_model.load_state_dict(chkpt['model'])
config['device'] = 'cpu'
print(generate_lstm(best_model, ' ', temperature=0.8, max_tokens=1024))
```

    is it anyone in the making is more and learning the Taiwanese card if you can get a hours
    Played
    Yeah thank you i take any countries and we want
    I did someone wanna need to take my good and I have a since to study country with those to be at this arrival the food about Arazina/here because we can change the portal or minerva mentioned carified. If we need to take that moment (it sending on ends by. Feel Gama
    We are just enter a whole bro school bick stript and take an emplain at our LBA target graph. The professes, and get out to go it
    Plana ed and on my higher, so it's just will be back 3 must always now it was sent up with the F1 lateraph airport so I know what is the week that they want it to 1 team or minerva just need to are seems something we can do other but you want to depend a little of money then.
    I want to do any vancial access to the first office
    It's a long in a common to the same to leave so so international section as well
    Hey guys I think you would not have an Mart!!!!! Can some arrives.
    In pr


### Transformer


```python
# Load the state with the lowest validation loss and generate text using it
chkpt = torch.load('transformer.pth', map_location='cpu')
best_model = SimpleLM(config)
best_model.load_state_dict(chkpt['model'])
config['device'] = 'cpu'
print(generate(best_model, ' ', temperature=0.8, max_tokens=1024))
```

## Loss


```python
transformer_loss = esimate_loss(model,  dl, 1000) # calculate loss for 1000 mini-batches
lstm_loss        = esimate_loss(lstmLM, dl, 1000) # calculate loss for 1000 mini-batches

print(f"tranformer loss = {transformer_loss['val']}; lstm loss = {lstm_loss['val']}")
```

    tranformer loss = 1.411583662033081; lstm loss = 1.498284935951233


As shown above, the transformer-based architecture achieves superior loss, but at much higher computational costs (roughly 3x training time on my machine as an example).

# Executive Summary

![Pipeline](pipeline.png)

In this work, I used data from an M25 group chat to train a generative text model. I discussed and built the transformer architecture with a character-based tokenizer and compared it to the LSTM architecture. Empirically, we showed that the transformer achieved a lower loss (cross-entropy) with a difference of ~0.1 but was much slower to train.

The text from both models is not complete gibberish (which is fantastic). Still, it also does not sound believable, likely due to a relatively small dataset for the task and a poor tokenization method. 

In future work, I look forward to exploring better tokenization techniques, pre-training the model on a more extensive corpus of data (or using an open-sourced model as the base and fine-tuning that).
